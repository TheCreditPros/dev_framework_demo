# Archived Scripts

This directory contains scripts that have been archived as part of the AI-SDLC Framework cleanup and consolidation effort.

## Archived Items

### commit-changes.py
- **Status**: Archived on $(date)
- **Reason**: Non-essential Python utility script in a JavaScript-focused framework
- **Original Location**: Root directory
- **Restoration**: Can be restored from git history if needed

## Archive Policy

Scripts are archived when they:
- Are not essential to the core framework functionality
- Create confusion about the framework's technology focus (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Are one-off utilities that are better maintained separately
- Have been superseded by better alternatives

## Restoration

If you need to restore an archived script:
1. Check git history for the original version
2. Copy it back to the appropriate location
3. Update any documentation references

## Contact

If you believe a script was archived in error, please create an issue in the repository.
