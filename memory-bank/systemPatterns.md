# System Patterns

This file documents recurring patterns and standards used in the project.
It is optional, but recommended to be updated as the project evolves.

2025-08-14 14:29:49 - Initial system patterns established for AI-SDLC framework

## Coding Patterns

- **Memory Bank Pattern** - Modular context preservation system with timestamped updates and cross-mode accessibility
- **AI-Enhanced Development** - Integration of AI assistance at each SDLC phase (planning, coding, testing, deployment)
- **Framework Agnostic Approach** - Core AI-SDLC patterns designed to work with multiple technology stacks
- **Progressive Implementation** - Incremental adoption strategy allowing developers to implement AI assistance gradually

## Architectural Patterns

- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between AI framework components and application-specific implementations
- **Context-Driven Architecture** - Memory Bank system providing persistent context across development sessions
- **Modular Framework Design** - Independent components for different SDLC phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment)
- **Technology Stack Demonstration** - Laravel/React combination as primary example with extensible patterns for other stacks

## Testing Patterns

- **AI-Enhanced TDD** - Test-driven development augmented with AI-generated test cases and edge case analysis
- **Cross-Stack Testing** - Integrated testing patterns covering both Laravel backend and React frontend components
- **Documentation-Driven Testing** - Tests that serve as both validation and documentation for AI-SDLC patterns
- **Continuous Validation** - Automated testing of AI-generated code and suggestions throughout development lifecycle
