## Project Goal

Create a comprehensive demo repository showcasing the AI-powered Software Development Life Cycle (AI-SDLC) framework specifically designed for Laravel/React projects. This repository will serve as a reference implementation and demonstration of how AI can be integrated throughout the entire development lifecycle.

## Key Features

* **AI-SDLC Framework Implementation** - Complete framework structure for AI-assisted development
* **Laravel Backend Integration** - Demonstrate AI integration patterns with Laravel applications
* **React Frontend Integration** - Show AI integration patterns with React applications
* **Development Workflow Examples** - Sample workflows for AI-assisted development
* **Documentation & Best Practices** - Comprehensive documentation for implementing AI-SDLC
* **Demo Applications** - Working examples of Laravel/React applications built using AI-SDLC
* **Testing Frameworks** - AI-enhanced testing strategies and implementations
* **Deployment Patterns** - AI-optimized deployment and monitoring solutions

## Overall Architecture

The repository will follow a modular architecture with separate sections for:
- Framework core components
- Laravel-specific implementations and patterns
- React-specific implementations and patterns
- Integration examples and demos
- Documentation and guides
- Testing suites and examples
- Deployment configurations and examples

The structure will enable developers to understand and adopt AI-SDLC practices incrementally while providing complete working examples.
