2025-08-27 - Major testing infrastructure upgrade: Jest â†’ Vitest migration complete

## Project Goal

Create a comprehensive demo repository showcasing the AI-powered Software Development Life Cycle (AI-SDLC) framework specifically designed for Laravel/React projects. This repository will serve as a reference implementation and demonstration of how AI can be integrated throughout the entire development lifecycle.

## Key Features

- **AI-SDLC Framework Implementation** - Complete framework structure for AI-assisted development (v3.3.0)
- **Laravel Backend Integration** - Demonstrate AI integration patterns with Laravel applications
- **React Frontend Integration** - Show AI integration patterns with React applications
- **Development Workflow Examples** - Sample workflows for AI-assisted development
- **Documentation & Best Practices** - Comprehensive documentation for implementing AI-SDLC
- **Demo Applications** - Working examples of Laravel/React applications built using AI-SDLC
- **Testing Frameworks** - Vitest-based testing infrastructure with AI-enhanced testing strategies
- **Deployment Patterns** - AI-optimized deployment and monitoring solutions
- **Modern Toolchain** - ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Commitlint, Lint-staged for code quality

## Overall Architecture

The repository will follow a modular architecture with separate sections for:

- Framework core components
- Laravel-specific implementations and patterns
- React-specific implementations and patterns
- Integration examples and demos
- Documentation and guides
- Testing suites and examples
- Deployment configurations and examples

The structure will enable developers to understand and adopt AI-SDLC practices incrementally while providing complete working examples.
