# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

2025-08-14 14:29:32 - Initial decision log created for AI-SDLC framework

## Decision

**Memory Bank Architecture for AI-SDLC Framework Demo** - Implemented modular Memory Bank structure with separate files for different contexts (product, active, progress, decisions, patterns)

## Rationale

- **Context Preservation** - Enables AI assistants to maintain project context across sessions and mode switches
- **Modular Organization** - Separates different types of information for better maintainability and updates
- **Cross-Mode Compatibility** - Allows different AI modes to access and update relevant context information
- **Scalability** - Structure can grow with project complexity while maintaining organization

## Implementation Details

- **File Structure**: 5 core files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md)
- **Update Strategy**: Timestamp-based append operations to preserve historical context
- **Access Pattern**: Sequential reading of all files during Memory Bank activation
- **Content Format**: Markdown with consistent formatting and timestamp requirements

## Decision

**Target Technology Stack for Demo** - Laravel (PHP) backend with React (JavaScript/TypeScript) frontend for AI-SDLC demonstration

## Rationale

- **Industry Relevance** - Laravel and React represent popular, modern web development technologies
- **AI Integration Potential** - Both frameworks offer extensive APIs and tooling for AI integration
- **Community Support** - Large developer communities with extensive documentation and examples
- **Scalability** - Both technologies support enterprise-scale applications

## Implementation Details

- **Backend**: Laravel framework with AI-enhanced APIs, middleware, and service patterns
- **Frontend**: React with AI-assisted component generation, testing, and optimization
- **Integration Points**: API communication, real-time features, and shared AI tooling
- **Demo Scope**: Complete working applications showcasing AI-SDLC at each development phase

## Decision

**2025-08-27 - Complete Migration from Jest to Vitest** - Replaced Vitest testing framework with Vitest across entire codebase

## Rationale

- **Performance** - Vitest offers significantly faster test execution with native ESM support and parallel test running
- **Modern Architecture** - Built on Vite, providing better integration with modern build tools
- **API Compatibility** - Vitest maintains high compatibility with vitest API, making migration straightforward
- **Developer Experience** - Better watch mode, improved error messages, and native TypeScript support
- **Framework Alignment** - Already using Vitest in main project, consolidating to single testing framework

## Implementation Details

- **Migration Scope**: 80+ test files modified across main repository and portal2-admin-refactor subdirectory
- **API Changes**: All `jest.*` calls replaced with `vi.*` equivalents (vi.fn() → vi.fn(), vi.mock() → vi.mock(), etc.)
- **Import Updates**: Changed all imports from "vitest" to 'vitest', added vi imports where needed
- **Edge Cases Fixed**: Handled special cases like vi.resetModules() and mock implementations
- **Migration Scripts**: Created comprehensive-jest-to-vitest.js and enhanced-jest-to-vitest.js for automated migration
- **Verification**: Confirmed zero Jest references remain in test code (excluding conversion scripts and comments)
- **Dependencies**: Kept @testing-library/jest-dom for compatibility, removed all Jest-specific packages
