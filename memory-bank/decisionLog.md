# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

2025-08-14 14:29:32 - Initial decision log created for AI-SDLC framework

## Decision

**Memory Bank Architecture for AI-SDLC Framework Demo** - Implemented modular Memory Bank structure with separate files for different contexts (product, active, progress, decisions, patterns)

## Rationale

- **Context Preservation** - Enables AI assistants to maintain project context across sessions and mode switches
- **Modular Organization** - Separates different types of information for better maintainability and updates
- **Cross-Mode Compatibility** - Allows different AI modes to access and update relevant context information
- **Scalability** - Structure can grow with project complexity while maintaining organization

## Implementation Details

- **File Structure**: 5 core files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md)
- **Update Strategy**: Timestamp-based append operations to preserve historical context
- **Access Pattern**: Sequential reading of all files during Memory Bank activation
- **Content Format**: Markdown with consistent formatting and timestamp requirements

## Decision

**Target Technology Stack for Demo** - Laravel (PHP) backend with React (JavaScript/TypeScript) frontend for AI-SDLC demonstration

## Rationale

- **Industry Relevance** - Laravel and React represent popular, modern web development technologies
- **AI Integration Potential** - Both frameworks offer extensive APIs and tooling for AI integration
- **Community Support** - Large developer communities with extensive documentation and examples
- **Scalability** - Both technologies support enterprise-scale applications

## Implementation Details

- **Backend**: Laravel framework with AI-enhanced APIs, middleware, and service patterns
- **Frontend**: React with AI-assisted component generation, testing, and optimization
- **Integration Points**: API communication, real-time features, and shared AI tooling
- **Demo Scope**: Complete working applications showcasing AI-SDLC at each development phase

## Decision

**2025-08-27 - Complete Migration from Jest to Vitest** - Replaced Jest testing framework with Vitest across entire codebase

## Rationale

- **Performance** - Vitest offers significantly faster test execution with native ESM support and parallel test running
- **Modern Architecture** - Built on Vite, providing better integration with modern build tools
- **API Compatibility** - Vitest maintains high compatibility with Jest API, making migration straightforward
- **Developer Experience** - Better watch mode, improved error messages, and native TypeScript support
- **Framework Alignment** - Already using Vitest in main project, consolidating to single testing framework

## Implementation Details

- **Migration Scope**: 805+ test files modified across three repositories
- **API Changes**: All `jest.*` calls replaced with `vi.*` equivalents (jest.fn() → vi.fn(), jest.mock() → vi.mock(), etc.)
- **Import Updates**: Changed all imports from "jest" to 'vitest', added vi imports where needed
- **Edge Cases Fixed**: Handled special cases like vi.resetModules() and mock implementations
- **Migration Scripts**: Created comprehensive-jest-to-vitest.js and enhanced-jest-to-vitest.js for automated migration
- **Verification**: Confirmed zero Jest references remain in test code (excluding conversion scripts and comments)
- **Dependencies**: Kept @testing-library/jest-dom for compatibility, removed all Jest-specific packages
- **File Extensions**: Fixed JSX parsing errors by renaming 52 test files from .js to .jsx
- **PR Updates**: Updated PR #482 with all migration fixes for portal2-admin-refactor

## Decision

**2025-08-27 - ESLint v9 Flat Configuration Implementation** - Migrated from legacy ESLint configuration to v9 flat config format

## Rationale

- **Modern Standard** - ESLint v9 flat config is the new standard, legacy configs are deprecated
- **Better Control** - More explicit and predictable configuration with better composition
- **TypeScript Support** - Improved TypeScript integration with @typescript-eslint parser
- **Test Support** - Proper configuration for test globals and browser environments

## Implementation Details

- **Configuration Files**: Created eslint.config.js using flat config format in all repositories
- **Global Definitions**: Added comprehensive globals for test environments (describe, it, expect, vi) and browser (fetch, URL, FormData)
- **TypeScript Integration**: Configured @typescript-eslint/parser and plugin for .ts/.tsx files
- **JSX Support**: Added ecmaFeatures.jsx for proper React component parsing
- **Ignore Patterns**: Configured to skip node_modules, dist, build, .next directories
- **Rules Configuration**: Set sensible defaults with warnings for unused vars, disabled console warnings

## Decision

**2025-08-27 - Quality Gates and Pre-commit Hooks Standardization** - Implemented comprehensive pre-commit and post-commit validation gates

## Rationale

- **Code Quality** - Enforce consistent code quality standards before commits
- **Early Detection** - Catch issues before they reach CI/CD pipelines
- **Team Efficiency** - Reduce code review cycles by automating quality checks
- **Framework Compliance** - Ensure all code meets AI-SDLC framework standards

## Implementation Details

- **Husky v9**: Git hooks automation for pre-commit, commit-msg, and post-commit
- **Lint-staged**: Run ESLint and Prettier only on staged files for efficiency
- **Commitlint**: Enforce conventional commit message format
- **Configuration Files**: Created .lintstagedrc.js to avoid package.json conflicts
- **Dependencies**: Installed prettier v3.6.2, eslint v8.57.1, @eslint/js v9.34.0
- **Validation Scripts**: Framework validation script confirms 3/4 checks passing (git hooks warning non-blocking)
