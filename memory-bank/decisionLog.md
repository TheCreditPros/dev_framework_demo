# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

2025-08-14 14:29:32 - Initial decision log created for AI-SDLC framework

## Decision

**Memory Bank Architecture for AI-SDLC Framework Demo** - Implemented modular Memory Bank structure with separate files for different contexts (product, active, progress, decisions, patterns)

## Rationale

* **Context Preservation** - Enables AI assistants to maintain project context across sessions and mode switches
* **Modular Organization** - Separates different types of information for better maintainability and updates
* **Cross-Mode Compatibility** - Allows different AI modes to access and update relevant context information
* **Scalability** - Structure can grow with project complexity while maintaining organization

## Implementation Details

* **File Structure**: 5 core files (productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md)
* **Update Strategy**: Timestamp-based append operations to preserve historical context
* **Access Pattern**: Sequential reading of all files during Memory Bank activation
* **Content Format**: Markdown with consistent formatting and timestamp requirements

## Decision

**Target Technology Stack for Demo** - Laravel (PHP) backend with React (JavaScript/TypeScript) frontend for AI-SDLC demonstration

## Rationale

* **Industry Relevance** - Laravel and React represent popular, modern web development technologies
* **AI Integration Potential** - Both frameworks offer extensive APIs and tooling for AI integration
* **Community Support** - Large developer communities with extensive documentation and examples
* **Scalability** - Both technologies support enterprise-scale applications

## Implementation Details

* **Backend**: Laravel framework with AI-enhanced APIs, middleware, and service patterns
* **Frontend**: React with AI-assisted component generation, testing, and optimization
* **Integration Points**: API communication, real-time features, and shared AI tooling
* **Demo Scope**: Complete working applications showcasing AI-SDLC at each development phase
