```

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Verify Framework Status

```bash
# Run validation script
npm run validate

# Expected output:
# 🔍 Validating AI-SDLC Setup...
# ✅ ESLint available
# ✅ Prettier available
# ✅ Husky available
# 📊 Validation Results: 3/4 checks passed
```

### 2. Test Git Hooks

```bash
# Create a test change
echo "// Test comment" >> test-file.js

# Stage and attempt commit (should trigger pre-commit hook)
git add test-file.js
git commit -m "test: verify git hooks functionality"

# Clean up test file
rm test-file.js
```

### 3. Verify GitHub Integration

```bash
# Check repository status
gh repo view

# List recent commits
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/commits --jq '.[0].commit.message'

# Check repository topics/labels
gh repo edit --add-topic "ai-sdlc,framework,development-tools"
```
