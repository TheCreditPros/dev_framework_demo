# Microsoft Teams Configuration Summary - AI-SDLC Framework v3.2.1

## 🎯 Best Process Forward for MS Teams Quality Gate Notifications

### Executive Summary

The AI-SDLC Framework now includes comprehensive Microsoft Teams integration specifically designed for **actionable quality gate failure notifications**. When commits or PRs fail quality gates, developers receive immediate, specific guidance on what actions to take.

## 🚀 Recommended Implementation Process

### Step 1: Channel Setup (5 minutes)

Create three dedicated MS Teams channels for different notification types:

```
📢 #ai-sdlc-main          - General CI/CD status updates and successes
🚨 #ai-sdlc-dev-alerts    - Quality gate failures requiring immediate developer action
🔒 #ai-sdlc-security      - Critical security vulnerabilities and FCRA compliance failures
```

**Why Three Channels?**
- **Noise Reduction** - Developers only get pinged for actionable items
- **Priority Separation** - Critical security issues get immediate attention
- **Context Preservation** - Different teams can focus on relevant notifications

### Step 2: Webhook Configuration (3 minutes)

#### For Each Channel:
1. Click **"..."** → **"Connectors"** → **"Incoming Webhook"**
2. Configure webhook names:
   - Main: **"AI-SDLC Status Updates"**
   - Dev Alerts: **"AI-SDLC Developer Actions"**
   - Security: **"AI-SDLC Security Alerts"**
3. Copy webhook URLs

#### Add to Repository Secrets:
```bash
# GitHub Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URI=<main-channel-webhook>      # General updates
MS_TEAMS_DEV_WEBHOOK=<dev-alerts-webhook>        # Action required
MS_TEAMS_SECURITY_WEBHOOK=<security-webhook>     # Critical security
```

### Step 3: Framework Integration (2 minutes)

```bash
# Test webhook connectivity
npm run teams:validate

# Test notification scenarios
npm run teams:notify-test      # Test failure notification
npm run teams:notify-security  # Security alert
npm run teams:notify-coverage  # Coverage warning
```

## 🚨 Quality Gate Failure Notification System

### Intelligent Routing by Failure Type

#### Test Failures → Developer Channel
**Notification Content:**
- ❌ **Specific Issue**: "Unit tests failed: 3 failures in credit calculation module"
- 📊 **Impact**: Coverage dropped to 75% (threshold: 80%)
- 🛠️ **Action Items**:
  1. Run `npm run test:coverage` to see detailed failures
  2. Focus on credit calculation edge cases
  3. Add FCRA compliance test coverage
  4. Use `npm run ai:generate-tests` for AI assistance
- 💻 **Immediate Commands**: Ready-to-run terminal commands
- 🔗 **Direct Links**: Workflow run, PR, coverage report

#### Security Vulnerabilities → Security Channel
**Notification Content:**
- 🚨 **Critical Alert**: "High severity vulnerabilities detected"
- 🔒 **Security Impact**: 2 critical, 5 high severity issues
- 🛠️ **Immediate Actions**:
  1. Stop development on this branch immediately
  2. Run `./scripts-complex/security-scanner.js full`
  3. Update vulnerable dependencies
  4. Validate no PII exposure
- 💻 **Security Commands**: Security-specific validation commands
- 📞 **Escalation**: Auto-mention security team for P0 issues

#### Performance Issues → Developer Channel
**Notification Content:**
- ⚡ **Performance Alert**: "Core Web Vitals budget exceeded"
- 📈 **Metrics**: LCP: 3.2s (threshold: 2.5s), FCP: 2.8s (threshold: 2.0s)
- 🛠️ **Optimization Actions**:
  1. Run `npm run ci:performance` locally
  2. Optimize bundle size and lazy loading
  3. Review credit calculation performance
  4. Test with Lighthouse CI
- 💻 **Performance Commands**: Performance testing and optimization
- 📊 **Budget Links**: Direct links to Lighthouse reports

#### FCRA Compliance Failures → Security Channel
**Notification Content:**
- 🏦 **Compliance Alert**: "FCRA regulatory violation detected"
- ⚖️ **Violation Type**: PII exposure, missing audit trail, invalid credit score range
- 🛠️ **Compliance Actions**:
  1. Review FCRA Section 604/607/615 requirements
  2. Run `npm run ci:compliance` validation
  3. Check PII encryption and audit trails
  4. Validate credit score range (300-850)
- 💻 **Compliance Commands**: Regulatory validation commands
- 📞 **Escalation**: Auto-mention compliance officer

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Notification Features

#### 1. Priority-Based Routing
```javascript
// Automatic channel selection based on failure type and priority
const getNotificationChannel = (failureType, priority) => {
  if (failureType === 'security' || failureType === 'compliance') {
    return 'MS_TEAMS_SECURITY_WEBHOOK';  // Critical security issues
  }

  if (['P0', 'P1'].includes(priority)) {
    return 'MS_TEAMS_DEV_WEBHOOK';       // High priority development issues
  }

  return 'MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URI';         // General notifications
};
```

#### 2. Actionable Content Generation
```javascript
// Generate specific action items based on failure type
const getActionableGuidance = (gateType, failureDetails) => {
  const guidance = {
    test: {
      actionItems: [
        'Run tests locally to identify specific failures',
        'Check test coverage and add missing tests',
        'Verify mock data and test setup',
        'Ensure FCRA compliance tests are passing'
      ],
      localCommands: [
        'npm run test:coverage',
        'npm run test:unit',
        'npm run ai:generate-tests',
        './ai-sdlc explain "test failures"'
      ]
    },
    security: {
      actionItems: [
        'Review security vulnerabilities immediately',
        'Update dependencies with security patches',
        'Check for exposed secrets or PII',
        'Validate FCRA compliance patterns'
      ],
      localCommands: [
        './scripts-complex/security-scanner.js full',
        'npm audit --audit-level=high',
        'npm run ci:security',
        './ai-sdlc explain "security vulnerabilities"'
      ]
    }
    // ... additional gate types
  };

  return guidance[gateType] || guidance.default;
};
```

#### 3. Smart Developer Mentions
```javascript
// Mention relevant developers based on CODEOWNERS and failure type
const getDeveloperMentions = (failureType, changedFiles) => {
  const expertiseMap = {
    'security': ['@security-team', '@senior-dev'],
    'compliance': ['@compliance-officer', '@legal-team'],
    'performance': ['@frontend-team', '@performance-expert'],
    'credit-calculation': ['@credit-team', '@algorithm-expert']
  };

  // Check CODEOWNERS for file-specific experts
  const fileExperts = getCodeOwnersForFiles(changedFiles);

  return [...(expertiseMap[failureType] || []), ...fileExperts];
};
```
