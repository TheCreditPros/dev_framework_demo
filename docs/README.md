## 📋 **Requirements**

**Basic Setup:**

- Node.js 18+
- Git repository (`git init` if new project)
- 5 minutes of your time

**AI-Powered Features (Optional):**

- OpenAI API key ($20-50/month)
- Qase account (existing)
- GitHub token (free)

## 🛠️ **Commands**

```bash
# Basic setup (run once per project)
./setup.sh

# Basic management commands
ai-sdlc setup        # Same as ./setup.sh
ai-sdlc status       # Check if working
ai-sdlc validate     # Run validation checks

# AI test generation (Level 2+)
ai-sdlc test-init    # Initialize AI test generation
ai-sdlc test-gen all # Generate tests for all files

# Help
ai-sdlc help         # Show all commands
```

## 💡 **How It Works**

1. **Detects your project** (Laravel/React/TypeScript/Node.js)
2. **Installs essential tools** (ESLint, Prettier, Husky)
3. **Sets up git hooks** to run automatically
4. **Creates working configs** - no editing required

## ✨ **What Happens When You Commit**

Every `git commit` automatically:

- Formats your code with Prettier
- Runs ESLint to catch issues
- Validates commit message format
- Prevents bad code from being committed

- Select 2-3 volunteer developers
- Implement on non-critical projects first
- Measure code review time reduction
- Document developer feedback

**Week 2: Level 1 Team Rollout**

- Roll out to entire development team
- Measure productivity improvements
- Collect success metrics for leadership

**Week 3-4: Level 2 Evaluation**

- Pilot AI testing on 1 critical project
- Calculate ROI from reduced test writing time
- Demonstrate Qase integration value

**Month 2: Full Implementation**

- Level 2 across high-priority projects
- Level 3 evaluation for production systems
- Present business case with measured results

### 🛡️ **Risk Mitigation**

- ✅ **5-minute rollback** if any issues
- ✅ **No workflow disruption** - completely transparent
- ✅ **Gradual adoption** - start with volunteers
- ✅ **Measured results** before full commitment

## 🆚 **Why This Beats Complex Alternatives**

### **AI-SDLC Simple:**

- ✅ **One command setup**: `./setup.sh` (actually works)

- ❌ **Constant maintenance** - breaks with updates
- ❌ **API key management** - security and cost overhead
- ❌ **Team training required** - weeks of onboarding
- ❌ **Configuration drift** - different setups per developer
- ❌ **Vendor lock-in** - expensive to change later

### **The "Do Nothing" Option:**

- ❌ **15-25 hours/week** wasted on manual code review
- ❌ **$50K+ average** production bug resolution cost
- ❌ **Inconsistent quality** across team members
- ❌ **New hire onboarding** takes 2-3 weeks
- ❌ **Technical debt accumulation** - expensive to fix later
- ❌ **Competitive disadvantage** - slower than automated teams
