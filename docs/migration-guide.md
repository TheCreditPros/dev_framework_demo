## 🎯 Migration Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
```bash
# Begin with a single repository
git clone existing-project ai-sdlc-migration-test
cd ai-sdlc-migration-test

# Implement foundation tools only
npm install husky lint-staged
npx husky install
# Test and validate before team rollout
```

### 2. Measure Everything
```javascript
// Track migration progress
const migrationMetrics = {
  phase: 'foundation',
  startDate: new Date(),
  teamSize: 5,
  toolsImplemented: ['husky', 'lint-staged'],
  issuesResolved: 0,
  productivityGain: 0 // %
};
```

### 3. Communicate Progress
