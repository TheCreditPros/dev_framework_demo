# CI/CD Implementation Guide - AI-SDLC Framework v3.3.0

## Overview

The AI-SDLC Framework now includes enterprise-grade CI/CD automation with comprehensive quality gates, security scanning, and performance monitoring. This implementation provides automated workflows for testing, deployment, dependency management, and code review processes.

## 🚀 GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline (`ci-cd-enhanced.yml`)

**Purpose**: Complete CI/CD pipeline with quality gates, testing, and deployment automation.

**Triggers**:

- Push to `main`, `master`, `develop`, `staging` branches
- Pull requests to `main`, `master`
- Git tags (`v*`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Key Features**:

- **Multi-stage Pipeline**: Setup → Quality Gates → Testing → Security → Build → Deploy
- **Matrix Testing**: Multiple Node.js versions (18, 20)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, Integration, E2E tests
- **SonarCloud Integration**: Code quality and coverage analysis
- **Security Scanning**: CodeQL analysis and dependency review
- **Automated Deployment**: Environment-specific deployments
- **MS Teams Notifications**: Real-time status updates

**Jobs Overview**:

```yaml
setup → quality-gates → test-suite → sonarcloud
↓
security-analysis → build → deploy → post-deploy-validation → cleanup
```

### 2. Security Analysis Pipeline (`security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security scanning and vulnerability assessment.
