## ðŸš€ What I'll Test Once You Provide This

### Test Sequence:
1. **Basic Connectivity** - Send a simple test message to verify webhook works
2. **User Mapping** - Configure your GitHub â†’ Teams mapping
3. **Quality Gate Notifications** - Send sample failure notifications with:
   - Test failure notification
   - Security alert notification
   - Coverage warning notification
   - Performance issue notification
4. **Proper @Mentions** - Verify your real name appears instead of GitHub handle
5. **Mobile Notifications** - Confirm notifications trigger on your mobile Teams app

### Expected Results:
You should see **4 test notifications** in your Teams channel:
- âœ… **Webhook Test** - Basic connectivity confirmation
- ðŸš¨ **Test Failure Alert** - Sample quality gate failure with actionable guidance
- ðŸ”’ **Security Alert** - Sample security vulnerability notification
- ðŸ“Š **Coverage Warning** - Sample code coverage notification

Each notification will include:
- **Your real name** instead of GitHub handle
- **Specific action items** for resolving the issue
- **Local testing commands** you can copy and paste
- **Direct links** to documentation and resources

## ðŸ“± Mobile Testing

After the notifications are sent:
1. **Check your Teams mobile app** - You should receive push notifications
2. **Verify @mentions work** - Your name should be properly mentioned
3. **Test action buttons** - Links should work on mobile
