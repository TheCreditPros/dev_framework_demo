# ðŸ“š AI-SDLC Glossary

## What This Framework Does

**AI-SDLC** - Automatically generates E2E tests when you change front-end files. No manual test writing required.

**Automatic E2E Generation** - When you modify `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.js` files, Playwright tests are created automatically.

**100% Test Coverage** - AI writes comprehensive test suites so you don't have to.

## How It Works

**Code Quality** - Your code gets formatted automatically on every commit. No manual formatting needed.

**Quality Gates** - Build fails if test coverage drops below 80%. Prevents bad code from reaching production.

**FCRA/FACTA Compliance** - Credit repair compliance patterns are built into every test the AI generates.

**Self-Healing Tests** - Tests automatically adapt when your UI changes. No maintenance required.

## What You Get

**OpenAI Integration** - Uses GPT-4 to generate intelligent test suites automatically.

**Playwright E2E Tests** - Complete user flow testing across browsers with zero manual writing.

**GitHub Integration** - Automatic code review and compliance checking on every pull request.

**FACTA Compliance** - Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act validation automatically included.

**PII Protection** - Personally Identifiable Information is automatically detected and protected.

## Business Impact

**80% Manual QA Reduction** - Eliminates most manual testing work through automation.

**$70,200+ Annual ROI** - Cost savings from reduced testing time and prevented bugs.

**60% Faster CI/CD** - Smart test execution only runs tests for changed files.

**Zero Manual E2E Writing** - Never write end-to-end tests manually again.
