### Implementation Steps

**Week 1: PR Automation Setup**

1. **Configure GitHub integration and MCP servers** (Development Manager)

   ```bash
   # Add to .env (if not already added)
   GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your-token-here

   # Initialize PR automation
   ./ai-sdlc pr-init

   # Connect MCP servers to Claude Code for enhanced AI assistance
   claude mcp add --config ./.mcp.json     # Registers all 10 MCP servers
   claude mcp list                         # Verify connection
   ```

2. **Test PR automation** (Implementation Manager)
   - Create test pull request
   - Verify automated review appears
   - Check compliance checking works
   - Validate security scanning

**Week 2: E2E Testing Implementation**

1. **Install Playwright** (Development Manager)

   ```bash
   npm install -D @playwright/test
   npx playwright install
   ```

2. **Generate E2E tests for critical flows with AI enhancement**

   ```bash
   # Credit repair specific flows with Claude 4.0 + MCP server integration
   ./ai-sdlc generate-from-requirements "Test credit report display with FCRA compliance validation"
   ./ai-sdlc generate-from-requirements "Test dispute submission workflow with PII protection"
   ./ai-sdlc generate-from-requirements "Test customer portal authentication and data access"
   ```

**ðŸ”„ Automatic E2E Test Generation:**

Once setup is complete, E2E tests generate automatically when developers commit front-end changes:

```bash
# Developer workflow - no manual test writing needed
git add src/components/CreditScoreCard.tsx  # Developer changes component
git commit -m "feat: add credit score animation"
# â†’ Playwright tests automatically generated for credit score interactions
# â†’ Tests include FCRA compliance validation
# â†’ CI/CD pipeline runs tests automatically
```

**Week 3: SonarCloud Validation and Full Integration**

1. **Validate SonarCloud configurations** (Implementation Manager - 30 minutes)

   ```bash
   # Set SonarCloud API token
   export SONAR_TOKEN=your_sonarcloud_token

   # Validate all TheCreditPros repositories
   ./ai-sdlc sonar-validate

   # Generate standardized templates
   ./ai-sdlc sonar-templates
   ```

2. **Apply consistent configurations across repositories**
   - **customer-frontend-portal**: Deploy templates with 85% coverage threshold
   - **portal2-refactor**: Deploy templates with 80% coverage threshold
   - **portal2-admin-refactor**: Deploy templates with 75% coverage threshold
