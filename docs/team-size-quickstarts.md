# üéØ Team-Size Specific Quick Starts

Optimized implementation paths for teams of different sizes and experience levels.

---

## üéØ Why Team-Size Matters

Different team sizes require different approaches to maximize ROI and minimize friction:

- **Solo Developers**: Need maximum productivity with minimal overhead
- **Small Teams**: Benefit from collaborative learning and shared setup
- **Medium Teams**: Require structured rollout and clear governance
- **Large Teams**: Need enterprise-grade deployment and change management

---

## üë§ Solo Developer (1 person)

**Focus**: Maximum productivity with minimal setup time
**Setup Time**: 5 minutes (fully automated)
**ROI Timeline**: Immediate

### One-Command Setup
```bash
# Complete automated setup with intelligent project detection
./ai-sdlc init

# That's it! Everything is configured automatically:
# ‚úÖ Git hooks (Husky + lint-staged)
# ‚úÖ Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
# ‚úÖ Testing framework (Vitest/Jest/Pest)
# ‚úÖ IDE configuration (VS Code settings)
# ‚úÖ CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions)
```

### Validation & Maintenance
```bash
# Verify everything is working (50+ automated checks)
./ai-sdlc validate

# Auto-fix any configuration issues (zero maintenance)
./ai-sdlc repair

# Quick status check
./ai-sdlc status
```

### Implementation Path
**Minutes 1-5**: Automated setup
- Run `./ai-sdlc init` for complete environment setup
- Automatic project detection (Laravel/React/TypeScript)
- All tools and configurations installed automatically
