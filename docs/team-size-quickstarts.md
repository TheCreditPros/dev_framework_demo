# 🎯 Team-Size Specific Quick Starts

Optimized implementation paths for teams of different sizes and experience levels.

## 🎯 Why Team-Size Matters

Different team sizes require different approaches to maximize ROI and minimize friction:

- **Solo Developers**: Need maximum productivity with minimal overhead
- **Small Teams**: Benefit from collaborative learning and shared setup
- **Medium Teams**: Require structured rollout and clear governance
- **Large Teams**: Need enterprise-grade deployment and change management
