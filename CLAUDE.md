## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Script Accessibility Requirements

**LESSON LEARNED (August 2025)**: Documentation sites must include actual working scripts for implementation manager review.

### **Documentation Repository Requirements:**

- ✅ **All working scripts MUST be copied to docs/ directory**
- ✅ **MkDocs navigation MUST include direct script access**
- ✅ **Scripts download page MUST provide implementation guidance**
- ✅ **Both repositories (main + docs) MUST stay synchronized**

### **Implementation Manager Access Checklist:**

- [ ] `auto-setup.sh` accessible via documentation site
- [ ] `ai-sdlc` CLI accessible via documentation site
- [ ] `scripts-complex/` directory accessible via documentation site
- [ ] Scripts download page with implementation instructions
- [ ] Direct download links working from documentation site

### **Synchronization Process:**

```bash
# Keep docs repository synchronized with main repository
cp auto-setup.sh ai-sdlc docs/
cp -r scripts-complex docs/
git add docs/
git commit -m "sync: update scripts in documentation"
```

**Why This Matters**: Implementation managers need to review actual script content before approving team rollouts. Without script access, the framework appears to be "documentation only" rather than a working solution.

### **Validation Tools Created:**

- ✅ **DOCUMENTATION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Comprehensive pre-deployment checklist
- ✅ **validate-documentation-deployment.sh** - Automated validation script

**Usage**: Run `./validate-documentation-deployment.sh` before any documentation deployment to prevent script accessibility issues.

### **Documentation Versioning Requirements:**

- ✅ **ALWAYS update version in mkdocs.yml footer** before deployment
- ✅ **Use semantic versioning** (v2.1.0, v2.2.0, etc.)
- ✅ **Include current date** in footer
- ✅ **Increment version** for any significant documentation updates

**Footer Format**:

```
Version: v2.1.0 | Updated: August 3, 2025
```

**Version Guidelines**:

- **Major (v3.0.0)**: Significant framework changes, new architecture
- **Minor (v2.6.0)**: New features, script additions, major functionality updates
- **Patch (v2.6.1)**: Bug fixes, minor documentation corrections

**Current Version (v2.6.0) Includes**:

- 4 new intelligent NPM scripts for optimized testing workflows
- Enhanced Vitest configuration with automatic coverage thresholds
- Playwright failure debugging with screenshot/video capture
- Optimized GitHub Actions workflow for resource efficiency
- Updated documentation across all 25+ guides for implementation clarity
