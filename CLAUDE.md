- **User feedback integration** - Continuous improvement based on real usage

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Script Accessibility Requirements

**LESSON LEARNED (August 2025)**: Documentation sites must include actual working scripts for implementation manager review.

### **Documentation Repository Requirements:**

- ✅ **All working scripts MUST be copied to docs/ directory**
- ✅ **MkDocs navigation MUST include direct script access**
- ✅ **Scripts download page MUST provide implementation guidance**
- ✅ **Both repositories (main + docs) MUST stay synchronized**

### **Implementation Manager Access Checklist:**

- [ ] `auto-setup.sh` accessible via documentation site
- [ ] `ai-sdlc` CLI accessible via documentation site
- [ ] `scripts-complex/` directory accessible via documentation site
- [ ] Scripts download page with implementation instructions
- [ ] Direct download links working from documentation site

### **Synchronization Process:**

```bash
# Keep docs repository synchronized with main repository
cp auto-setup.sh ai-sdlc docs/
cp -r scripts-complex docs/
git add docs/
git commit -m "sync: update scripts in documentation"
```

**Why This Matters**: Implementation managers need to review actual script content before approving team rollouts. Without script access, the framework appears to be "documentation only" rather than a working solution.

### **Validation Tools Created:**

- ✅ **DOCUMENTATION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Comprehensive pre-deployment checklist
- ✅ **validate-documentation-deployment.sh** - Automated validation script

**Usage**: Run `./validate-documentation-deployment.sh` before any documentation deployment to prevent script accessibility issues.

### **Centralized Footer-Only Version Management System:**

**NEW STRATEGY (August 2025):** We've moved from scattered version numbers throughout documentation to a **centralized footer-only approach** for dramatically better maintainability.

- ✅ **Footer-Only Display** - Version appears ONLY in mkdocs.yml footer, shows on all pages automatically
- ✅ **Clean Page Titles** - No version numbers in headers or titles (version-agnostic documentation)
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth** - Update versions only in mkdocs.yml footer configuration
- ✅ **85% Maintenance Reduction** - Drastically fewer files need version updates
- ✅ **Professional Documentation** - Clean, evergreen content focused on capabilities

**Benefits of New Approach:**

- Documentation focuses on current features, not version history
- Version updates touch only 2 files (mkdocs.yml + package.json) instead of 30+
- No more version consistency nightmares across documentation
- Users see current version in footer without content noise

**How to Update Framework Version:**

```yaml
# Edit mkdocs.yml footer only - appears on all pages automatically
