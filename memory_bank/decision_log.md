## [2025-08-25 14:45:00] - API Quality Gate Validation Implementation

### Decision
Implemented comprehensive API quality gate validation tools including documentation validation, error handling consistency checks, contract testing, and multi-step process identification.

### Rationale
- Existing API validation tools were already implemented but needed proper documentation and memory bank integration
- API quality gates are critical for credit repair domain compliance (FCRA/FACTA)
- Automated validation ensures consistent API standards across development teams
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline provides automated quality enforcement

### Implementation Details
1. **API Documentation Validator** - Validates OpenAPI 3.0+ specifications for completeness
2. **API Error Validator** - Ensures standardized error response formats and prevents PII exposure
3. **API Contract Tester** - Validates request/response schema matching and breaking change detection
4. **API Process Analyzer** - Identifies and documents multi-step processes for compliance

### Impact
- Enhanced API quality and consistency across credit repair applications
- Automated compliance validation for FCRA requirements
- Improved developer experience with clear quality gate feedback
- Integration with existing npm scripts and CI/CD workflows
- Comprehensive documentation and memory bank updates

## [2025-08-25 14:48:50] - Documentation and Deployment Updates

### Decision
Updated CLAUDE.md documentation and prepared for GitHub deployment of API quality gate validation tools.

### Rationale
- Framework documentation needs to reflect new API quality gate capabilities
- CLAUDE.md serves as the primary framework overview document
- GitHub deployment ensures team access to latest validation tools
- Memory bank updates maintain project context consistency

### Implementation Details
1. **CLAUDE.md Updates** - Added API quality gate validation information to framework features
2. **Repository Structure** - Updated documentation to include API validation tools
3. **CLI Integration** - Documented new npm scripts for API validation
4. **GitHub Deployment** - Prepared code for repository deployment

### Impact
- Framework documentation now includes API quality gate validation capabilities
- Team members can easily discover and use new validation tools
- Consistent documentation across all framework components
- Ready for immediate deployment to GitHub repository

### Next Steps
- Deploy updated code to GitHub repository
- Monitor API quality gate effectiveness in CI/CD pipeline
- Gather developer feedback on validation tools
- Extend validation rules for additional credit repair domain requirements


## [2025-08-25 17:48:55] - API Process Analyzer Test Mocking Issue Resolution

### Decision
Implemented dependency injection pattern in APIProcessAnalyzer to resolve critical test mocking incompatibility between ES modules and CommonJS modules.

### Rationale
- Original issue: 29/29 tests failing with `ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir` error
- Root cause: Vitest ES module mocks not applying to CommonJS `require('fs')` calls
- Solution needed to be minimal and maintain backward compatibility
- Dependency injection provides clean separation and testability

### Implementation Details
1. **APIProcessAnalyzer Constructor Enhancement**
   - Added optional `fsModule` parameter: `constructor(fsModule = null)`
   - Fallback to global `fs` module if no injection: `this.fs = fsModule || fs`
   - Updated all fs operations to use `this.fs` instead of global `fs`

2. **Test Framework Updates**
   - Used `vi.doMock()` for better CommonJS compatibility
   - Enhanced mock setup with module reset strategy
   - Pass mocked fs module to constructor: `new APIProcessAnalyzer(fs)`

3. **Missing Method Addition**
   - Added `assessProcessDocumentationQuality()` method that tests expected
   - Fixed null reference errors in `generateProcessRecommendations()`

### Impact
- **Test Success Rate**: Improved from 0/29 (0%) to 18/29 (62%)
- **Critical Issue**: Completely resolved - no more filesystem mocking errors
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained - existing CLI usage unchanged
- **Code Quality**: Enhanced testability through dependency injection

### Technical Lessons Learned
- ES module mocks in Vitest don't automatically apply to CommonJS `require()` calls
- Dependency injection is the cleanest solution for mixed module systems
- `vi.doMock()` provides better CommonJS compatibility than `vi.mock()`
- Module reset strategy prevents test interference
