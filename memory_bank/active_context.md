[2025-08-25 17:11:46] - CRITICAL TEST ISSUE RESOLVED: API Process Analyzer Test Mocking Problem

## Problem Solved
Fixed the APIProcessAnalyzer test that was failing with `ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir '/mock/project/reports/api-processes'` error after 10+ attempts.

## Root Cause
The issue was a mocking incompatibility between ES modules (test file) and CommonJS modules (APIProcessAnalyzer). The fs module mocks were not being applied to the CommonJS `require('fs')` calls in the APIProcessAnalyzer constructor.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Added dependency injection** to APIProcessAnalyzer constructor to accept fs module as parameter
2. **Updated all fs calls** in APIProcessAnalyzer to use `this.fs` instead of global `fs`
3. **Modified test setup** to pass mocked fs module to constructor
4. **Used vi.doMock()** for better CommonJS compatibility

## Results
- **Before**: 0/29 tests passing (all failing with mkdir error)
- **After**: 18/29 tests passing (main issue resolved)
- **Remaining failures**: Test logic issues, not mocking problems

## Technical Changes
- Modified [`scripts-complex/api-process-analyzer.js`](scripts-complex/api-process-analyzer.js:16) constructor to accept fsModule parameter
- Updated all fs operations to use `this.fs` instead of global `fs`
- Enhanced test setup with proper mock injection and module reset strategy
