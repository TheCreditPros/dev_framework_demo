# PHP/Laravel Examples

This directory contains PHP and Laravel example files that were part of the original AI-SDLC framework demo. These files are kept for reference and demonstration purposes but are not part of the main React/TypeScript project.

## Contents

- `composer.json` - PHP dependency management file
- `phpunit.xml` - PHPUnit testing configuration
- `app/` - Laravel application structure examples
- `database/` - Database migration examples

## Purpose

These files demonstrate the multi-stack capabilities of the AI-SDLC framework, showing how it can work with both frontend (React/TypeScript) and backend (Laravel/PHP) technologies.

## Note

These files are not actively used in the current project setup and are kept for reference only. The main project focuses on React/TypeScript development with AI-powered testing and quality gates.
